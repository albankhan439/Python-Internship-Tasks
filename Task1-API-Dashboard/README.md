## 📝 Objective

- Fetch weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API
- Visualize the temperature trends using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`

## 📁 Files Included

- `weather_chart.png`: (Optional) A saved graph showing the temperature forecast

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- `requests`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## ▶️ How It Works

1. Sends a GET request to OpenWeatherMap’s 5-day forecast API
2. Extracts date/time and temperature from the JSON response
3. Plots the temperature over time in a line graph

## ⚙️ How to Run
